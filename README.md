# 🧠 ChromaDB CRUD Operations – Colab Demo

This repo contains a **Google Colab notebook** where I practiced **CRUD operations** using [ChromaDB](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma), an open-source vector database.

### 📌 Purpose
Learn the basics of vector databases by testing:
- **Create** – Add documents and embeddings
- **Read** – Query with semantic similarity
- **Update** – Modify stored data
- **Delete** – Remove entries

### ⚙️ Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python
- ChromaDB (`chromadb` library)

### 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Colab
2. Run each section to see CRUD operations in action
3. Try changing the inputs to explore more!

This is part of my learning journey into **AI memory and vector search systems**.
