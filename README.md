# 🧠 ChromaDB CRUD Operations – Colab Demo

**Vector databases** are designed to handle unstructured data such as text, images, audio, and more.  
These types of data are first transformed into **high-dimensional vectors** using **embedding models** (like those from OpenAI, Hugging Face, or Sentence Transformers).  
Once converted, vector databases store these embeddings and allow fast similarity searches — essential for AI-powered features like semantic search, recommendations, and memory.(chromadb has default embedding model,if we want we can use other models as well by importing)

This repo contains a **Google Colab notebook** where I practiced **CRUD operations** using [ChromaDB](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma), an open-source vector database.

### 📌 Purpose
Learn the basics of vector databases by testing:
- **Create** – Add documents and embeddings
- **Read** – Query with semantic similarity
- **Update** – Modify stored data
- **Delete** – Remove entries

### ⚙️ Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python
- ChromaDB (`chromadb` library)

### 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Colab
2. Run each section to see CRUD operations in action
3. Try changing the inputs to explore more!

This is part of my learning journey into **AI memory and vector search systems**.
